            <p>Hello, this is the translated version of Teaching Feeling created by @reihangimahermawan8992. This is the official version of Teaching Feeling available on Dlsite. As it is originally a Japanese game, the H-scenes are censored and some elements are altered, but almost all the dialogues in the game are in English.</p>
